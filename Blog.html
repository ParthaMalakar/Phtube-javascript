            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const ?

        <div class="collapse-content">
            <h3><b>var:</b></h3>

            <p> Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the
                function where they are declared.
                Hoisting: var declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope, but
                their assignments are not hoisted.
            </p>
            <h3><b>let:</b></h3>

            <p>Block-scoped: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are accessible only within
                the block (e.g., within loops or conditionals) where they are defined.
                No hoisting: Unlike var, let variables are hoisted to the top of their block but are not initialized
                until the line where they are declared is executed.
            </p>
            <h3><b>const:</b></h3>
            <p>

                Block-scoped: Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped.
                Constant value: const variables cannot be reassigned after their initial value is set. However, for
                objects and arrays, the values within them can be modified, but the variable itself cannot be assigned a
                new value.

            Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <h3><b>null:</b></h3>
            <p><b>Explicit absence of value: </b>null is used to explicitly indicate the absence of any object value or
                no value at all. It is often used as a placeholder to represent that a variable or property
                intentionally has no value or has been cleared.</p>

            <p><b>Initializing variables:</b> You can initialize a variable with null to signify that it hasn't been
                assigned any meaningful value yet.</p>
            <h3><b>undefined:</b></h3>
            <p><b>Default uninitialized value: </b>In JavaScript, variables that are declared but not initialized are
                automatically assigned the value undefined. It represents the absence of an assigned value.
            </p>
            <p><b>Function parameters:</b>When a function is called with fewer arguments than declared in its
                parameters, the missing parameters are undefined.
            </p>
            <p><b>Object properties:</b> If you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns
                undefined.</p>

            What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>RESTful APIs are commonly used in web development to enable communication between different software
                systems over the internet. They are known for their simplicity, scalability, and widespread adoption due
                to their alignment with the HTTP protocol, making them a popular choice for building web services and
                APIs.</p>
